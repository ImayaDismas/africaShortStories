           <h1>The Second Death of Martin Lango<br>by Helon Habila</h1>
            <p>A NIGERIAN writer, 33-year-old Helon Habila, has won the $15,000 Caine prize for his prison-diary story, “Love Poems” (Epik Books, Lagos).
Mr Habila is the arts editor of Vanguard, a Lagos newspaper, as well as a published poet. A Christian from the mainly-Muslim north of Nigeria and an outspoken newspaper columnist, he firmly believes that Muslims and Christians can peacefully co-exist in Nigeria and has not been afraid of taking the authorities to task for inciting religious clashes in the north.</p>

                    <h2>The Second Death of Martin Lango</h2>
                    <h5>by Helon Habila</h5>

                    <p><h6>A phone call from an old friend sets Charles thinking of his former life in Nigeria, but the connection between Lagos and Washington DC is difficult to establish in this new story from Helon Habila, the latest in our series of short fiction to mark the anniversary of 9/11</h6><br>"Your brother called."
<br><br>
"Whose brother?"
<br><br>
The line from Lagos was cutting in and out.
<br><br>
"Your brother, Martin."
<br><br>
Rachael didn't speak for a long while. In the background I could hear the rumble of planes – she was on her way to a conference in Abuja.
<br><br>
"It can't have been Martin."
<br><br>
"Why not?"
<br><br>
"Listen, I'm just about to check in, I'll call you soon."
<br><br>
For Rachael Lango, "soon" usually meant nothing less than a year or two, and there was little point in trying to call back. She would call me out of the blue to tell me about her latest boyfriend, a new car, or yet another promotion, but she never picked up the phone herself. She started working for a Chinese toy outlet straight after we left university and had risen rapidly over the last ten years, now she managed a chain of stores around Lagos.
<br><br>
Once she hadn't called for almost four years, and we only got back in touch when I bumped into her former roommate – who used to be my girlfriend – just before I moved to America in 1995. Rachael had just started going out with one of her Chinese colleagues – we talked for almost thirty minutes.
<br><br>
"What's he like?"
<br><br>
"Well, very Chinese."
<br><br>
"Do you love him?"
<br><br>
"He makes me laugh. I am almost forty, Charles. Love is not that high on my list of priorities." Rachael had always been a pragmatist. Back in school she had always kept two or three boyfriends at a time, just in case.
<br><br>

Martin had called at four in the morning. I sat up and fumbled on the bedside table for my phone, cursing whoever had called. It was most likely from Nigeria, they mostly didn't seem to realise there's a five-hour time difference between Nigeria and the US, or they just didn't care. The number was blocked.
<br><br>
"Charles?"
<br><br>
"Yes?" I answered.
<br><br>
"Listen, you may not remember me, but eleven years ago, you and me, we sat in my sister's room in Port Harcourt and discussed books. You lent me a novel, Smiley's People by…"
<br><br>
"Le Carré. Yes, I know the book. But who are you?"
<br><br>
"This is Martin Lango, Rachael's brother."
<br><br>
"Martin?"
<br><br>
He laughed nervously, anxiously. "You do remember me, don't you? Rachael's brother. We met only once."
<br><br>
"Are you calling from Nigeria? It is 4 am here."
<br><br>
"Listen, I am sorry. But I am here in DC. I need help."
<br><br>
"It is 4 am, Martin. How did you get my number?"
<br><br>
"Phonebook," he said cryptically.
<br><br>
"I am not in the phonebook."
<br><br>


"Hey congrats, on winning the visa lottery."
<br><br>
I won the visa lottery and moved to America six years before. Like everyone else, I wanted a piece of the American dream, little realising how long it takes to get it. My master's degree in business management had only got me a job as security in the local Giant superstore. But it was okay. When Martin called I only had two years to wait before I'd get my American passport. I was thirty five, and single.
<br><br>
"Listen, I really need help. A little money, not much. I need to get out of where I am right now. There are some Jewish people looking for me. I shouldn't even be talking about this."
<br><br>
"What are you talking about?"
<br><br>
"Look, I got into the precious stones business and I stepped on some toes. Jewish toes. It is all I can say for now."
<br><br>
"Have you called your sister?"
<br><br>
"No, no. She must never know that I contacted you. Please."
<br><br>
"But if you are in trouble…"
<br><br>
"She can't help."
<br><br>
He wanted four hundred dollars to get out of "where he was". I sent him two hundred by Western Union.
<br><br>

We had taken to each other immediately when we met – the only time we met – at Rachael's flat back in Port Harcourt. She had a large, quiet living room overlooking a tree-lined back road not far from the campus, with picture frames, chairs, curtains and carpet all in pink. I used to hang out in this very feminine environment with my girlfriend, Bola, who happened to be Rachael's room-mate. I entered without knocking and didn't see Martin at first. He was seated by the window, with a book in his hand, watching me with a half-smile on his face.
<br><br>
"Sit down," he said.
<br><br>
I asked him what he was reading.
<br><br>
"Dashiell Hammett, The Maltese Falcon."
<br><br>
"Good writer, I just finished The Thin Man."
<br><br>
"I've read that. I've read all of his books."
<br><br>
"You like detective stories then," I said, wondering who he was. Perhaps he was one of Rachael's many boyfriends.
<br><br>
"I do, but my real favourite is spy. John le Carré."
<br><br>
"I like him too. I have his Smiley's People."
<br><br>
"I haven't read that."
<br><br>
"You must. I can lend it to you."
<br><br>
"I leave tomorrow evening."
<br><br>
Just then Rachael entered. He turned to her.
<br><br>
"Hey sis, I like your boyfriend. He is a regular fellow," he said, affecting an American accent. Rachael stood by the bedroom door, shaking her head.
<br><br>
"Hello Charles. I see you've met my dumb brother. He is not my boyfriend, Martin. He is Bola's boyfriend."
<br><br>
"Hey, but I could be your boyfriend."
<br><br>
"No, you couldn't. Shut up. I don't know who is dumber, you or him."
<br><br>
Martin had stopped by on his way to his university in Benin where he was a second year Pharmacy student. The next morning I brought Smiley's People to class and gave it to Rachael.
<br><br>
"I promised your brother this."
<br><br>
He was on drugs, I noticed that right away. Whatever it was, heroin or cocaine, it had changed everything about him. We were somewhere near Dupont Circle; Martin had chosen the place. The little Italian restaurant was empty – the lunch crowd wouldn't be here for another hour. Martin was wearing a ridiculous zoot suit and a tie, like something out of a 1930s movie. All that was missing was the felt hat and the pointy shoes. The suit was old and unwashed, the stitching was going on his Doc Martens – the heels were so worn he rolled from side to side as he walked. And this pudgy, time-worn face. Could this be the handsome, sardonic young man I had met many years ago? He was balding already.
<br><br>
"So," I said, pretending not to be shocked, "what will you have?" The waitress watched us out of the corner of her eye as she cleaned the next table. She seemed unsure, like I was, what to make of Martin's suit and the wild gestures he made as he told me of nights spent on cold park benches, and days spent washing dishes in Chinese restaurants just to eat. His girlfriend had kicked him out, he told me, she was the reason he came to the DC area in the first place – he used to live in California. He had been here a year now. The waitress came over and stood with her eyes lowered to her little notepad, her muscles tensed for flight at the slightest alarm. He ordered a cheese burger, and a beer, and a carrot cake for dessert. I ordered tea.
<br><br>
"So, what of the Jews that were after you?" I asked.
<br><br>
He looked up, his mouth full. "What Jews?"
<br><br>
"The precious stones people?"
<br><br>
"No, they are Lebanese, actually. I worked for them in Nigeria, they promised me so much, including an American passport…" he stopped talking and waved his hand. "That is in the past. Now, I need a little help… and I'll pay you back, I swear. I'll pay you back, dead or alive. In this life or the next. I always pay my debts."
<br><br>
"Don't worry about repaying me…"
<br><br>
"No." He stood up dramatically and put his hand on his chest. He looked down at me with desperate solemnity. "Dead or alive. It is a promise."
<br><br>
"Sit down, please." I noticed the waitress now hovering by the kitchen doorway. He sat down and picked up his burger.
<br><br>
"When did you leave Nigeria?"
<br><br>
"A long time ago. Man, it's been a long time. I was in Europe for a while, then Brazil, and now here I am."
<br><br>
"Why don't you call your sister?"
<br><br>
He shook his head violently and said nothing.
<br><br>
"Well, I told her I had talked to you…"
<br><br>
He threw down his burger and put both hands to his head. The waitress bolted into the kitchen.
<br><br>
"Oh no, no man. Why did you do that? Oh no, oh no." He stood up and walked to the door, then back again, still shouting, "Oh, no." I was afraid he'd start throwing chairs.
<br><br>
"Martin, calm down. Calm down." I'd started shouting too. The waitress came back out with the chef and a man in a shirt and tie. I stood up, gesturing that it was OK, and dropped some money on the table.
<br><br>
"Let's go," I said, grabbing Martin by the arm. He pulled away from me.
<br><br>
"Do you want my help or don't you?" That got his attention. We went outside and sat on a bench next to a fountain. "Okay, Martin. What do you need?"
<br><br>
He said he needed a ticket to California. His application for citizenship had been accepted, and he had to get back to LA to swear the oath of allegiance. I took him to Dulles airport on September 11, 2001, and stayed with him until he went through security. He left on American Airlines flight 77, at 9am, for Los Angeles.
<br><br>
"So, you are now an American," Rachael said, "congrats."
<br><br>
"Sometimes I feel I went to America too late, that I'll never really fit in."
<br><br>
I was in Lagos with my wife and child for a month's vacation – the first time I'd been home since I left over ten years ago. I felt different, as if I had lost my way and ended up in another dimension, just like I felt when I first arrived in America, in St. Paul, Minnesota. It wasn't until I moved to DC that I realised I could live in the US. There were so many black people it was like being in Lagos, except the electricity worked, the traffic lights worked, and the police were more visible, especially in my black neighbourhood.
<br><br>
We were in a Chinese restaurant owned by Rachael and her husband, The Peking Place, in Victoria Island. She had left the toy company three years ago. Rachael had also changed in other ways; she was bigger, impressively so; her two chins wobbled as she spoke, even her hand gestures were grand and all-encompassing. Her husband, a thin, short man with impeccable bedside manner excused himself and got up from the table at last.
<br><br>
"I never talked to you about what happened to your brother," I said, I felt awkward.
<br><br>
She sighed. "My brother died, not long after you met him in my room while we were at college …"
<br><br>
"But I met him in DC. I put him on one of the planes …"
<br><br>
She went on, looking straight at me, "He was working for some Lebanese people as a courier. Precious stones. Well, one day he ran away with the stones, to Lagos. It was worth a lot of money. Millions, they claimed. They caught him, Charles, and they killed him. We heard it from the police. That's it."
<br><br>
"Did you see the body?"
<br><br>
"Yes. We buried him. I can take you to the grave if you want. Whoever you met was not my brother."
<br><br>
The zoot suit, the restaurant, the ride to Dulles and the flight to fire and disaster – the words died on my lips. She stared at me from across the table.
<br><br>
"Whoever you met was not my brother."</p>
