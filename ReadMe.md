###Explains what my repo is about###

This is a website known as Africa Short Stories that:

> *provide a way to learn about peoples and cultures through literature - short stories. Through these stories we can get at least glimpses, and in many cases, pretty clear pictures, of the lives and thought worlds of groups of people.*
> *one can access only 10 Short stories using this site. Almost all of them are award-winning.*
