                    <h2>A Party For The Colonel</h2>
                    <h5>by F.T. Kola</h5>

                    <p>All evening, groups of white people came up to shake the Colonel’s hand and to say sweet things to his wife. The Colonel was the nickname his son had given him, though he had never been in the military. It was due instead to his bearing, which was splendid. The Colonel exhibited no anxiety at being admired. Not even in the grand, rose-colored ballroom of the Johannesburg La Fontaine, a hotel that a man of his race—Indian, as he and his wife’s identity documents declared—could not normally enter as a guest. But the Colonel’s wife was uncomfortable. Whenever, from within the room of round tables with their peach tablecloths and bouquets of flowers, a new and unknown lady approached her and told her she must be so proud, she could barely form the words to respond. The Colonel’s wife was a stout woman, as sweet and cautious as a milking cow, with a face permanently crumpled into pre-emptive embarrassment. She had never been around so many white people in her own country before. She had, as a girl, patched together the facts of the Apartheid laws
 
she lived under and her own meager education to form the idea that every single one of them hated her, and so the evening for her proceeded as a series of mounting terrors. Each sparkling smile and jewel-laden hand on her shoulder filled her with panic. She sat, traumatized and still, holding her toddler grandson in her lap like a shield, offering mute smiles to anyone who spoke to her.
<br><br>
  Now and then she threw a helpless glance in the Colonel’s direction, but he never so much as met her eyes. He had made a show of avoiding the sight of their grandson, whose presence so annoyed him. But it was also clear to her that the Colonel was entirely unaware of her agony for the simple reason that he was enjoying himself, for this was a party held in his honor.
<br><br>
The Colonel had become the first agent of the Gold Lion Insurance Company in South Africa to earn more than 25 million rand in insurance sales. He sat erect, surveying the scene before him with conscious nobility, as if he were a king looking at his subjects for the pleasure of knowing that they were looking at him. He wore thick-rimmed glasses in the fashion of twenty years earlier and a mustache, neatly clipped and carefully waxed. His hair was pomaded into tight, mildly greying waves. When he stood tall—and he always stood tall, because he had excellent posture—he conveyed a sense of natural authority. His skin was as brown and smooth as a hazelnut, and he always smelled of clean linen, thanks to Eunice, their African maid, who, under his strict orders, spent an hour painstakingly hand-washing his clothes every evening.
<br><br>
On the drive toward the hotel, the worries that the Colonel’s wife had managed to ignore all day began to blossom, uncomfortably,
inside her. At first she had only concerned herself with her grandson, but now she imagined what would happen once they actually turned up at the party. Although the Colonel could well have afforded it, they had never so much as stepped inside one of the fancy downtown hotels before. She worried that they would be denied entry outright, and that her husband would make one of his scenes. Sure enough, when they arrived the Afrikaner security guard outside the hotel had taken one look inside the Colonel’s forest green Mercedes and held out a palm to halt them, before leaning his body through the window to ask exactly what they thought their business was. The Colonel’s wife sat stiff against her seat, holding her grandson’s face against her neck, a panicked sweat instantly bathing her lower back, anticipating the ensuing conversation with dread, and as it happened—as the Colonel angrily ordered his driver to move on and park the car, because they were going in, no matter what this bloody boer, this rooinek said—she heard herself desperately trying to placate everyone, saying that they had an invitation but of course the guard was only doing his job, that there was no need to argue. They would wait politely until someone could check that they were supposed to be there. But everyone had ignored her. The Colonel sat stubbornly; barking at his driver to drive on while the security guard grew increasingly red-faced and furious and threatened to call the police. The police might really have been called, and the security guard would have been in his rights to do so, except that the wife of the Gold Lion Company’s President had turned up to rescue them.
<br><br>
The woman had appeared breathless, coming down the lighted pathway from the lobby in a light jog, holding the silk skirt of her salmon-colored gown above her ankles, her face all flushed.
 <br><br>
 
With a sort of natural elegance that the Colonel’s wife found herself immediately envying, the woman sweetly explained to the guard that the Colonel was her guest and hadn’t this been prearranged and discussed with the management? She would have to complain. And so the Colonel’s driver had driven them right up to the marble pillars that flanked the hotel’s entrance, and a slightly confused African bellboy had opened the car door, and the Colonel had stepped out of the car, upright with pride. The white guests milling around the entrance were too polite to do anything but stare, curiously. The Colonel had floated through the lobby and into the ballroom like a debutante, and the Colonel’s wife had followed behind, her little grandson a burning weight in her arms, all too conscious of the eyes upon her.
<br><br>
As a girl, the Colonel’s wife had frequently wondered what the grand ballroom of the La Fontaine would look like. It was a place that often appeared in the wedding announcements at the back of The Sunday Times, a section that she and her sisters would liberate from their father as soon as the newspaper came, and go into a corner to examine carefully. They delighted in the sophisticated sounding English names in particular, ones that sounded like characters from films or Enid Blyton books; the curious details of parental jobs (judge, chief of police, government minister); and most of all, the always sparse details of the wedding reception, which only lent a heightened glamor to their imaginings.
<br><br>
Once the Colonel’s wife was actually standing in the ballroom that she had pictured as a girl, she was disappointed to see that it was not at all how she had imagined. There were no chandeliers. Instead there were strangely shaped light shades that hung unevenly, perhaps artistically, from the ceiling. The room was not marble. Everything, including the walls, was carpeted in dusty
 
shades of pink and pale browns. She had expected classical music, assuming it to be omnipresent on all such occasions, but there was a band playing jaunty jazz-like numbers instead. With a hot, embarrassed feeling in her stomach, she noticed that the other women gathered around tables or drinking champagne wore long gowns or fitted jumpsuits, mostly silk and satin, in pastel colors, with little jewelry. Somehow, they had all known what to wear. She herself wore a wool suit, olive-colored, with lace trim on the sleeves and collar, that she had thought appropriately glamorous. She had taken out her best jewelry—her wedding jewelry, heavy and gold. There were no other children at the party. Her grandson, three years old, stood shyly behind her legs.
<br><br>
The President of the Gold Lion Company and his wife walked rapidly towards them, the President clapping his hands with delight. A girl, blonde head lowered, in a flowing dress the color of rust, had followed.
<br><br>
“Mr. Ibrahim!” the President had said. “Well hello! What an honor it is! What do you think of all this?” He gestured to the party behind him. “I told my girls, what a brilliant achievement this is for Gold Lion South Africa! That is, a great achievement for you, yes, but also for all of us. Even in London they’re talking of our—your—great success. Let’s have a big bash, for once. Leave our restraint at home.”
<br><br>
“Bravo,” the Colonel said. “You have done a wonderful job, Mr. Greyling.”
<br><br>
The President had reddened with pleasure, examining the Colonel with admiring eyes. When his wife leaned over to tap him on the hand, he started. “Oh,” he said. “This is my wife, Justine.” The President’s wife was smiling tightly at him, and he seemed to remember something. “Oh yes, you’ve already met.
<br><br>
And my daughter, Elizabeth. Come on, Elizabeth.” He waved his hand impatiently at the girl.
<br><br>
Their daughter was perhaps in her early twenties, the youngest person there after the Colonel’s grandson. The girl had a broad, freckled face, the freckles disappearing at her jawline and then reappearing, floridly, all over her tanned upper arms. Her blonde hair hung loosely around her face. She said nothing, but stared at the Colonel’s wife with a look of apology on her face that the Colonel’s wife did not understand.
<br><br>
“Mrs. Ibrahim,” the President’s wife Justine said, extending a gracious hand. “It is so lovely to meet you, properly. And who is this? Your son?”
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife had not even been able to open her mouth to speak. No words would rise in her throat.
<br><br>
“It is our grandson,” the Colonel said, and his wife knew it must bother him even to explain. “He is called Riyaz. He is three.” “Your grandson!” Justine exclaimed. She bent down to the little boy, who clutched his grandmother’s leg with renewed fervor.
<br><br>
“Oh, he is all suited up. What a sweet boy. Well, hello, Riyaz.” “But you should have told us,” The President said. “Of course

it’s wonderful to bring him, just wonderful, but if we had known, we would have brought Elsie, our maid. She loves children. Of course, the rest of your family would have been welcome too, Mr. Ibrahim.” “Dad,” Elizabeth said, a tone of embarrassment in her voice.
<br><br>
“Well, come on, let’s introduce you to everyone,” the President said, gesturing toward the room. “We have space for the little man, of course. And you must consider Elizabeth here your nanny for the evening. She is at your disposal. Mrs. Ibrahim, feel free to hand the little fellow off to her right now if you like. This is your night, you must enjoy it.”
<br><br>
 
As soon as the President had turned away, his hand on Justine’s lower back, the Colonel had turned to his wife and in a voice that stung whispered, “You see? Mohammed is destroying my celebration and he is not even here. Now we must treat the President’s daughter like a maid. An old woman like you dragging a child around. She was mocking you when she asked if it was yours. They think you look ridiculous.”
<br><br>
Mohammed was their only child, the father of the little boy. He had been arrested six months ago. It was the fourth time in two years. Selima, his wife, had come by yesterday with tears in her eyes, pressing the grandson on the Colonel’s wife, full of explanations about her own sick mother and the impending drive of over a thousand kilometers to Cape Town before her. “What does she think?” the Colonel had asked, when he had come up from the office that night to find Riyaz sitting at the dining room table and sticking his fingers in a bowl of chocolate Maltabella porridge. “She can take the child on protest rallies and get him sprayed with tear gas, teach him all that ANC nonsense, but she can’t drive in a car with him? Lazy. Irresponsible. Doesn’t even want to look after her own child. These feminists are like that. I knew she was no good.” The Colonel’s wife had said nothing in response to this. When they went to bed, she had nestled the little boy between them, ignoring the Colonel’s disgruntled muttering, holding the child close to her, away from the Colonel’s broad, irritated back.
<br><br>
She had forced herself to disregard her husband’s complaints, and had used the money he allocated each morning for fresh fruit and groceries to buy a tiny suit for Riyaz, even though she knew he would not want the boy at the event. She and their maid Eunice had gone shopping for the suit together. The streets had been half-
<br><br>
empty in the pale morning light, closed off because of a protest happening at the university a few blocks away. Now and then the Colonel’s wife could hear the sounds of the distant crowd: the static-filled cries of Amandla! shouted by some young man through a microphone, followed by the responding roar of the crowd’s Awethu! Power—to us! The two women had quickened their pace; spoke less than they usually might. As the Colonel’s wife silently filled Eunice’s arms with paper bags of food and the child’s suit wrapped in a sheath of plastic, she thought that Eunice must be thinking about Mohammed, too.
<br><br>
When her husband found Riyaz sitting beside her on the plump leather seat of the Mercedes, the child’s chestnut curls carefully brushed and his new suit ironed by Eunice, the Colonel had erupted with anger. But his wife had simply watched him from the inside of the car, detached, pretending that she couldn’t even hear him, though the little boy himself had burst into tears.
<br><br>
What she could not tell the Colonel was this: she had come to believe that the moment she let go of her grandson she would be letting go of her son. That the instant her skin ceased to have contact with the child’s warm body, somewhere in some dark and unknown place her son would cease to exist. All she could do was to keep the little boy close to her, to imagine that by some transitive property, her own son would be safe. And so in the grand ballroom of the La Fontaine, she did not hand the little boy to the President’s daughter, who was waiting by expectantly, but instead lifted the little boy back up into her own arms. Avoiding the Colonel’s glare, she stepped forward to follow the President to their table.
<br><br>

For the rest of the night the Colonel and his wife sat like a bride and groom whose futures had been arranged, newly revealed to
<br><br>
each other and instantly dissatisfied. At intervals, people came to offer their congratulations, and left again. Waiters moved around them almost clinically, filling water glasses and replacing cutlery, offering bread and folding abandoned napkins. The Colonel’s wife watched the impassive faces of these Black men, some so young they must have been barely out of school, others older than she was, entranced by the deliberateness with which they completed their tasks. If Mohammed were there, no doubt he would have spoken to the waiters, declaring that he was not interested in engaging with whites, only those that he called his brothers. But the Colonel’s wife found herself as unable to speak to them as she had to the ladies who visited her table, unable to ask them for juice or a soft drink, instead of the untouched wine that sat before her. For however out of place she felt, they seemed not to notice her.
<br><br>
The Colonel and his wife had been seated with the President and his family, who were almost never at the table, but spent their time moving about the room, dispensing small talk and sharing laughter. Every so often the Colonel’s wife would catch glimpses of them, in between the movement of waiters and elegant ladies in their gowns and men in tuxedos. Everybody had natural groups to fall into, she noticed, the women in particular greeting one another enthusiastically. She realized, with a faint surprise, that of course these people all knew each other before this evening—they had been to each other’s children’s weddings and summer houses and dinner parties. It was only she and the Colonel who were new.
<br><br>
At turns, the little boy crawled under their legs, held his grandmother’s hands and hopped to the jazz music, ate spoonfuls of broiled sole and lemony rice, banged the cutlery against the table and crawled into his grandmother’s lap to kiss her. At one point, when the Colonel had been beckoned away by the
<br><br>
President, and she was wiping Riyaz’s mouth with a heavy pink cloth napkin, a group of women came to sit down at the table, taking up all four abandoned seats across from her, and cheerfully declared that they must speak with her.
<br><br>
“Mrs. Ibrahim!” the first one, a woman with a brown bob had said. “We’ve been admiring your lovely suit from across the room. Congratulations, by the way, we all know that your husband’s success must really be down to you.”
<br><br>
“Yes,” said another, wearing bright blue eye shadow. “But it’s just so dreadful, going on all those long trips in a car to drink tea in a stranger’s living room and talk insurance. How can you even bear it?”
<br><br>
“I know I can’t,” said brown bob. “My husband talks so long too. The other day we drove all the way to a farm in Nelspruit. Ag, I thought we’d be there for days.”
<br><br>
“Nelspruit!” a chubby one with green eyes said. “That’s baie ver.”
                        <br><br>
“Is this your grandson?” asked blue eye shadow. “I heard Justine Greyling mention that you brought him here. Isn’t he handsome?”
<br><br>
The women all cooed over the little boy. The Colonel’s wife was gratified to see that he never left her, never ran around the room, but stayed beside her as if tethered. Now, with the attentions of four strangers focused on him, he hid under her chair, one tiny hand around her ankle.
<br><br>
“Riyaz,” she said gently, and felt the little boy head-butt her calf, like a cat.
<br><br>
“Oh shame, he’s so shy,” the fourth woman said. She was very tall with androgynous features, so slim she looked as if she could be folded in half like a piece of paper.
<br><br>
“You know, Mrs. Ibrahim,” said brown bob. “We were just discussing the seasoning on the fish and I said, it doesn’t taste very fresh. I’m sure it’s all from a box, you know how places like this can be. Cutting costs every which way. The Oriental Plaza— now my girlfriends say that is a curious place to shop. They must have wonderful spices and such things there. Is it true?”
<br><br>
“But is it good quality?” demanded blue eyeshadow. “I don’t like to spend any money if it’s just going to go vrot or break.”
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife did not know how to reply. The fear, still tight inside her, was mitigated only by a realization that her silence was not an impediment to the conversation continuing. Still, she was relieved when the President tapped a microphone and hushed everyone into silence, and the four women retreated, with many whispered apologies and vows to speak with her again later, back to their seats.
<br><br>
Some minor awards were handed out; one to blue eye shadow’s bashfully stooping husband, and then the President began to speak of the Colonel. His was a remarkable achievement, the President of the Company said from the podium. What an auspicious start to 1977. And the Colonel had been so inventive, seeking out new markets. What a privilege it was to award a man who was not only an accomplished insurance agent but also an upstanding member of the community, who was a motivation to them all. And a native of Johannesburg, the President added, a city which the company had always thought had a great potential for business. What was not said by the President—and what the Colonel’s wife realized could never be said—was the reason that the Colonel had sold so many insurance plans where other agents had not. It was due to the same fear that she felt now, the fear that beat in the heart of everyone who was not permitted to enter a

<br><br>
hotel like this. No white agent, turning up to a family home on a Sunday afternoon, in an area unfamiliar to him, selling things to people who believed he wished only to do them harm, could dispel it. But the Colonel was different. He was the same as the people that he sold to, and this, his wife had realized, was his gift.
<br><br>
The Colonel and his wife lived in a near-deserted part of inner city Johannesburg. When they had first moved there, Mohammed was just a few months old: an infant boy whom the Colonel’s wife clothed lovingly in white knitted dresses and embroidered bonnets. At that time the area had been lively and crowded—a chaotic mix of African fruit stalls and Malay cafés and Indian bazaars and Chinese grocery stores. It was the kind of place the Colonel’s wife had grown up in, the kind she was familiar with— there had always been someone for her to talk to, someone to help her when Mohammed got colicky, to chat over the garden fence with while their children played in the street. She had been happy, but had quickly realized that the Colonel was not.
<br><br>
When they first married her husband worked as a high school mathematics teacher, a terrifying presence who was more than willing to belt a student for a misdemeanor, yet wise enough that his students began to rely on him for advice in matters of marriage, career and family. In their small community he had become a figure of respect, and she was proud when he began to court her. It wasn’t until after they were married that she discovered the Colonel had been born in a remote area of the Transvaal, that his family was poor and that on top of that he was the illegitimate son of an unmarried Malay woman, his father’s mistress, a fact for which his stepmother never forgave him, for which she had made him sleep outside, and denied him even the

tiniest kindnesses. For the Colonel, becoming a teacher had only been the first step in proving himself.
<br><br>
They had wanted more children after Mohammed, but two years into their marriage the local doctor, a heavily bearded and religious man, had told them that she would never give birth again, that something inside her was twisted up. Fortunate, he had added, that you have already given your husband a son.
<br><br>
Something had cooled between them after that. The Colonel worked harder, taking on more classes, until one day he came home and announced that he had quit. It was money, he declared to his wife, that was a man’s ticket out of whatever limits others may place on him. Money was the great equalizer; it would take them places, it would open doors for their son, and lubricate even the most stubborn parts of the Apartheid system. And so, the Colonel had signed up with the one company that would have him. He became an insurance man.
<br><br>
It was natural that his former students, continuing to seek his advice, should also buy insurance from him, and the Colonel found that the government-created ghetto had left him with a niche market. White people preferred white insurance agents, and so he confined his business to fellow Indians, Muslims, and Malays, Coloureds, and Blacks, and they, reassured by the fact of him, had given him their business. The Muslims were the easiest. He could extract from his glove box a seldom used topi to place upon his head, assume the language of the pious and enter any living room on a wintry Johannesburg evening to settle comfortably into a chair and ease himself into a conversation by virtue of sheer goodwill, smoke endless cigarettes and accept numerous cups of tea. No white agent could have done that. No white agent would even have been in these areas at evening time,
<br><br>
when shops were closed and groups gathered to gossip and eat. The people felt comfortable with him. They trusted that he was genuinely concerned, that he knew best—after all, he was an educated man, and he was one of them. The Colonel was good at his work. He visited grieving widows, gave advice to fatherless sons, helped mediate in difficult marriages, sent boxes of fruit and flour and a joint of meat to the people he knew were struggling. When clients turned up at the door, often unexpected, seeking some urgent advice or hoping to assuage a worry, the Colonel’s wife would assume her own face of confident cheerfulness, and would set the table with her finest china. Platter after platter would come sailing out of the kitchen, as if a prince had come to dine.
<br><br>
The tendrils of trust he had cultivated spread ever outward. There was no one he would not sell insurance to. The Coloured man that the Colonel’s wife bought fish from in the market, the ministers of the Homelands and fresh-faced Black teachers who were eager to participate in the professional classes, the Hindu family next door to every Muslim one. He would even try, now and then, to convince a maid or gardener on his way out of a home that they too might benefit from life insurance, though they had not a penny to spare. After another day of successful sales, he would come home and assume his place at the head of the table, eat the same sparing dinner he ate every night (he did not believe in overconsumption), and remind his wife and his increasingly disinterested son again of the secret of his success: that he treated everyone as if they were important enough to buy insurance. The lives of these people had value, the gift was in telling them that, and if you could put a price on their life—it only proved the point.
<br><br>
The more money the Colonel made, the more he was convinced that all along he had been right. But the Colonel’s wife, in private moments, thought differently. The Colonel’s money did not bring them favor, or let them into the forbidden places from which they would always be excluded: it merely let them pretend, sometimes, that Apartheid didn’t exist at all. Where the fact of inequality crept into their daily lives, the Colonel simply replaced the inevitable with the illusion of choice; going only to the Indian cinemas because there were no “for use by white persons” signs since no white people ever went there at all; sending Mohammed to a private school in Botswana; telling his wife to take a more scenic route from the market rather than the direct path through the cemetery where white children would hide behind the gravestones to throw rocks at her; never going to the annual Rand Easter show where a man of his color would be denied entry on certain days or to the nicest pavilions no matter how much he might pay for a ticket, but where the poorest white would be allowed to enter.
<br><br>
In the summer, the family went on trips to places where one could be treated as an equal: to Spain, to England, to Botswana, to Portugal. The Colonel managed eventually to buy the largest building in their area, one that took up the whole corner of the block, and had given himself a spacious set of offices downstairs and leased the rest out to a café. He had tasked his wife with transforming the upper floor (which the Colonel preferred to call the penthouse) into a charming warren of imported marble tiles, costly fabrics, and modern conveniences. They had hired Eunice, and the Colonel had built a sparse, four-by-four room on the roof for her to live, a room in which she would live for the next thirty years. For the Colonel’s wife, Eunice soon became
<br><br>
like a friend and daughter, as well as an older sister to her son, so much so that she often forgot Eunice had a family of her own, in far off Transkei, a husband and child whom she saw just once a year.
<br><br>
It had stung the Colonel’s wife a little when Mohammed, at sixteen, had come home on school holidays to admonish his parents for hiring Eunice, claiming that they imprisoned her, and asking why she was not permitted to eat dinner with the family. He followed Eunice around while she made beds and chopped vegetables and washed the floors, lecturing her on Communism. The Colonel’s wife had to shoo her son away—Can’t you see she’s busy?—and the Colonel and Mohammed had fought in the evenings once Eunice was safely away in her own room. The Colonel claimed that hiring Eunice was practically charity, and besides, this life was something he had earned, while Mohammed accused him of trying to live like a white man, blind to the fact that he would never be one. Though she would never say it to her husband, the Colonel’s wife agreed. They did not live in Houghton, or Hillbrow. The view from their windows was bleak, and the stink of frying from the café below made its way into every gold-embroidered sofa cushion and filigree cedar wood shutter. They would never be able to go any further than they had come.
<br><br>
The President’s speech ended, the strings of the orchestra stirred, and couples moved to dance. The Colonel’s wife watched as her husband sat back with an expression of immense satisfaction and surveyed the scene. The little boy was now asleep, his head in his grandmother’s lap, the rest of his body on one of the cushioned pink seats next to them. The Colonel turned to his wife for the
<br><br>
first time in the evening and smiled, a genuine smile. It was so unexpected that she wanted to say something kind to him, when she saw a man approaching.
<br><br>
“Hallo Mr. Ibrahim!” the man bellowed, pushing four fat fingers into the Colonel’s shoulder. “Mind if I sit?” He was large, and stunk strongly of alcohol.
<br><br>
“Please do,” the Colonel said.
<br><br>
“Congratulations to you,” the man said. “I tell you, five months ago I tried working those same streets as you—Lenasia— and I couldn’t get a penny from anybody. I’d say, what the hell’s the matter with you? Don’t you want life insurance? What will happen to you and your little bambinos if you pass away? And the bloody fools would just look at me like I was an alien.”
<br><br>
The Colonel leaned forward. All night, the Colonel’s wife noticed he had relished the ability to tell people about his various sales techniques, his little mechanisms to earn trust and to ingratiate himself with his clients, but now, the large man would not give him the opportunity. He slapped the table.
<br><br>
“I tell you what,” and here the man leaned forward, “if more people were like you, keeping their heads down and making their living, we would be a different country. There’s a lot of complaining here but no one works hard and gets himself a forward momentum. No matter who or what you are, I believe you have to prove yourself, you understand?”
<br><br>
“That’s what I tell my son,” the Colonel said.
<br><br>
“Good man,” the man replied, slapping the table again. “I hope he’s like you.”
<br><br>
“This is my wife,” the Colonel said. The Colonel’s wife half expected the man to make some terrible joke, but his bleary eyes barely settled on her. Instead, he bent his face low to the table.
<br><br>
“I’ve got a wife too,” he mumbled, and reared up and shouted so loud that several people turned to look. “Anna!”
<br><br>
A smiling woman, with bangs that fell over her forehead like little sharp teeth, was bustling towards them, a concerned expression on her face. “These are the Ibrahims,” the man said, winking. “He’s the bastard who’s been stealing all our business.” “You’re awful, Rodney,” Anna said. “Oh, Mr. Ibrahim, Mrs. Ibrahim, I hope my husband hasn’t offended you. He says whatever comes into his head when he drinks.” She sat down at

the table. <br><br>“Is that your little boy?”
<br><br>
“No, he belongs to our son,” the Colonel said.
<br><br>
“So you’re a grandfather! How nice. And what does your son do?”
<br><br>
“He is a doctor,” the Colonel said, hesitating for only a moment. “Almost. He’s only halfway through medical school.”
<br><br>
“Oh, wonderful,” Anna said. “It’s simply a marvel that your people always seem to be doctors, isn’t it? Just the most intelligent of the bunch, you must be. Our children don’t have any discipline. Lorraine is a dancer and Henry a lawyer, well, we’ll see if he makes it.”
<br><br>
“Bloody fool won’t make it,” Rodney said, thumbing the sleeve of a passing waiter and pointing at his glass.
<br><br>
“And you, Mrs. Ibrahim? How do you spend your time? Do you work?” Anna said, leaning forward over the table as if she intended to reach out and touch the Colonel’s wife. “I’m mad about book clubs. Host them for the mothers in the neighborhood. We raise money for charity. Recently we’ve been quite political. We spent at least four meetings discussing all the rampages. My word. Even Rodney was shocked. Our maid Onika’s daughter was there. I told her as soon as I saw the news,
<br><br>
go home, find your daughter, don’t worry about the ironing, we were so shocked. They were just children, you know? To shoot at them like that! Lorraine was in London, she told me all about the BBC footage. But then what choice did they have? And we all said, where were the mothers? Would I let Henry go out that way, and act like that? Burning down your own school, not learning Afrikaans, how can you be trusted if you can’t act civilized? How can you get a job? That’s how you get respect. It’s absolutely essential. Look at you, Mr. Ibrahim, you are so successful.”
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife felt herself nodding away, though she had barely taken in any words Anna had said. She wanted to ask how old Onika’s daughter was, and if Onika had found her. It was in those same riots in Soweto that Mohammed had been arrested. The last time she had seen her son, the last time she had hugged him— the warmth of his body beneath his woolen jumper, the scratchiness of his beard on her ear—had been that morning. He had turned up at their door asking for money—the Colonel had cut him off after he was expelled from medical school for his political activity. The Colonel’s wife had stood by the kitchen window hearing their argument echo up from downstairs, before her son ran up, furious, brushing aside her offers to make him breakfast, which is all she had to give him, though she would have given him anything.
<br><br>
After the riots she had telephoned every hospital in the city, but no one matching his description had been found. Selima had finally found out from someone that Mohammed had been arrested, and detained, either at John Vorster Square Prison or some farm somewhere, some remote place where they took terrorists. The Colonel had made inquiries through a lawyer that had come to nothing, and then he had given up, saying that Mohammed had made his bed and should lie in it.
<br><br>
John Vorster Square was only a few blocks away from the La Fontaine Hotel. The Colonel’s wife wondered what would happen if she got up right now, left the ballroom, walked out into the street, knocked on the door of the prison, and asked the security police for her son. Demanded him back. That was what a mother should do. But she could not even bring herself to move. The sleeping boy was a weight in her lap, his little hand curled around one of her fingers. She wondered what Onika’s daughter looked like.
<br><br>
“Bunch of bloody idiots chattering, those women,” Rodney was saying. “Don’t know their arses from their elbows. Think they’re fashionable to be radical. I tell you when I see those bloody crowds all lifting their fists up like that and jabbering in the air, Amanda or whatever it is they say, my blood turns cold.”
<br><br>
Anna ignored him, smiling apologetically at the Colonel. “The President said you live in Johannesburg. Is it true? I thought all your people lived in Lenasia or Bosmont. Or is it Newclare? I think that is terrible, by the way, forcing people to move. Just unacceptable.”
<br><br>
“We live in Pageview,” the Colonel said, clearing his throat. “We have always lived there.”
<br><br>
It wasn’t entirely true. If it had been her, the Colonel’s wife would never have said it, because Pageview was only the most recent place from which the family had not been forcibly removed. Just a few years into the Colonel’s insurance business, when they still lived in a small cottage and Mohammed had been just eight, the community had been upended. Paranoid that all the non-whites were plotting revolution, the government had vowed to create separate ghettos for each race. Early one morning the Colonel’s
<br><br>
wife had been hanging out the washing when the telltale white car with its government number plate had cruised into the narrow street, delivering a pair of official looking white men with sheafs of papers in their arms. Removal orders. The Colonel and his wife had been evicted maybe four or five times in their lives, and they knew what happened next.
<br><br>
For the next four weeks, as his wife silently served the Colonel his breakfast, they heard the unmistakable rumble of bulldozers and voices shouting in Afrikaans that all must vacate their houses on threat of arrest. The Colonel’s wife had repeatedly asked the Colonel where they were to go, watching anxiously as her neighbors packed up and left, as street signs were removed, yet the Colonel remained distressingly silent, until one day he arrived home and in a confident voice told her they were not going to move at all. While stooping down to pull up the metal cover from the front of the insurance office that morning, he had stepped into the velvet green coolness of desks and filing cabinets and simply decided that they would not leave. Let the government knock everyone’s house down. Let the new white residents occupy every house, every apartment. The Colonel’s family would remain.
<br><br>
Every morning the bulldozers and German shepherds arrived to hector and terrorize. The Colonel sat stoically at his desk surrounded by papers while his wife hid, terrified, in the bathroom of their home upstairs, Mohammed pressed to her skirts. She prayed out loud for them to remain safe, envisioning the claw of a bulldozer breaking through one of the concrete walls of their living room. That is where the Colonel had found her every evening, the dinner uncooked, their son distressed and confused. It seemed only to make him more insistent that they defy the order, though she often tried to persuade him just
<br><br>
to move. What did it matter? Wouldn’t it be less trouble? But the Colonel ignored her. He employed the talents of a young Jewish lawyer who sent increasingly lengthy and dense letters to the Department of Community Development with a regularity bordering on harassment. The Department had eventually stopped responding, which the young lawyer counted as a victory, and since no police had turned up to forcibly evict the family, they assumed they had been consciously forgotten.
<br><br>
It turned out that the white people the government had cleared the area for did not want to live there, and so the rubble of bungalows and bazaars and cafés lay where it had fallen. Now, over a decade later, the area was still near empty. A few families here and there, and businesses that relied on trade passing through: a cemetery, an auto salvage yard run by a deaf man of indeterminate ethnicity with a drooling mastiff, and a big open square that the Colonel’s apartment looked over, in which nothing but a couple of sad trees, bent drowsily, had survived. To his wife’s surprise, even after the area was deserted, the Colonel’s business continued to thrive. The clients still came in from the Indian ghetto, a lonely concrete development in the open veldt with half-built and neglected structures everywhere, and from Eldorado Park, where the houses crowded against one another and tumbles of barbed wire sat atop every roof.
<br><br>
“Oh, yes, Pageview,” Anna said. “Rodney, are you too drunk to dance? What about you, Mr. Ibrahim?”
<br><br>
“Well?” the Colonel said, turning to his wife. Her grandson remained sleeping in her lap. The boy looked like a tiny, drunken elf, his suit crumpled, his cheeks flushed, one little hand entangled in his curls. The Colonel’s wife was surprised at the suggestion.
<br><br>
Her husband had never before wanted to dance. Their wedding had been traditional and religious, only her parents and an imam, no dancing, and he was not a romantic man. Even when they went on their trips to Spain, when they sometimes went to restaurants in which people danced after dinner, and she had sometimes wished that he would take her hand, he would not do so. Today, though, he apparently wanted to dance in front of all these white people.
<br><br>
“Rodney!” the President said. “What are you telling Mr. Ibrahim? Nothing troublesome I hope.”
<br><br>
It seemed like the Colonel’s wife was perpetually being rescued by the President and his wife, who were heading towards their table, their daughter again in tow.
<br><br>
“We were just seeing who wanted to dance,” Anna explained.<br><br> “Ah ha! We noticed that you were not dancing. No one wants to dance, until they do. As I said, Elizabeth is here, and she is a

competent babysitter.”<br><br>

The Colonel stood up. “Thank you,” he said. “My wife would appreciate that.”<br><br>

“Excellent,” the President said. “And you too, Rodney. Your wife is waiting. Don’t fall over just yet. Come on, Mr. Ibrahim.” They all got up, except the Colonel’s wife. Elizabeth sat next to her, and spoke breathlessly. “Don’t be nervous,” she said, “I’ll take good care of him. You go and dance. By the way, I really admire your husband so much, I’ve been supporting the Progressive Reform Party, you know. Though don’t mention it to my dad. I try to go on the protests when I can, though it’s difficult…we’re the laughing stock of the world in South Africa. I was in Amsterdam for three months earlier this year and I found

it so refreshing, to be able to mingle.”
 <br><br>
“I don’t usually dance,” said the Colonel’s wife.
<br><br>
“Oh, go on,” Elizabeth said, reaching out to pluck the child from her arms.
<br><br>
For a moment, the Colonel’s wife tightened her hold on Riyaz. But Elizabeth’s hands were already on the boy’s waist, and the Colonel’s wife briefly envisioned each of them pulling the child away from the other until he snapped in two. Elizabeth was smiling at her, beseechingly, and staring into the girl’s eyes the Colonel’s wife had a moment of sudden, terrible realization. Whatever bad thing she had tried to avert by gripping onto this boy, it had already happened. That Selima had handed him over, that the little boy was with her, was the sign she had been dreading all along, the proof she had been waiting for so anxiously. Nothing she did, and nothing she could do, mattered. She relaxed her grip on the little boy, felt him suddenly lighten as Elizabeth took the bulk of his weight, and the Colonel’s wife let one of her hands run down his chubby little leg down to his foot, so that when Elizabeth finally pulled him away she was left with nothing but a single tiny leather shoe in her hand. The Colonel’s wife looked at it, turned it around, as if it she had never seen it before.
<br><br>

The boy opened his sleepy eyes, and reached up to grab a fistful of Elizabeth’s hair. Elizabeth laughed and reached out to take the shoe, and nudged the Colonel’s wife gently.<br><br> “Go on,” she said. “Don’t worry about him.”
<br><br>
The Colonel was waiting by the dance floor, and with halting steps, in a pair of brown suede pumps that made her feet ache, the Colonel’s wife moved toward him. Couples nodded appreciatively as they joined. “Well done!” a man said, raising a glass full of champagne. The Colonel’s wife realized how desperately thirsty she was. A waiter was nearby with a silver water jug and a napkin
<br><br>
folded over one arm, but he passed by before she could say anything. She felt even more nervous now. Everyone was looking at them. The truth was that neither of them really knew how to dance. But the Colonel gripped her hands, and made a show of doing what the others around them appeared to be doing.
<br><br>
“Maybe now,” she ventured, feeling bold, “we can move to London. All of us.”
<br><br>
The Colonel did not reply, but instead turned her awkwardly in his arms. She looked for her grandson. Elizabeth had taken him away from the table. He was dancing around in circles near the band, with Elizabeth looking on, saying something to him.
<br><br>
The Colonel was smiling broadly, looking at everyone but his wife. A couple nearby were dancing in an elaborate way, tracing their fingers along each other’s arms and spinning around, and the other couples had moved back to give them space. The Colonel’s hands felt heavy and stiff on his wife’s shoulders, manipulating her clumsily like an unyielding toy.
<br><br>
“We are doing just fine here,” he said. “What would we want in London? You want me to live like my brother in Manchester? And run a fruit shop? He can’t even afford heating in the winter.”
<br><br>
“No,” the Colonel’s wife said, her voice small, “but there is Gold Lion there also. You have more money than your brother. He will sponsor us for the visa. And Riyaz, he could go to school….”
<br><br>
“There is nothing wrong with where we live now.”
<br><br>
“But Mohammed,” she said, and the Colonel tightened his grip on her shoulders.
<br><br>
“I don’t want to hear his name,” he said, “not tonight. He has destroyed things enough as it is.”
<br><br>
She looked into her husband’s face as he grit his teeth. It was an expression she knew well, one that her son had not inherited. His face was always open, even in anger, wide-eyed, astounded. But in his resoluteness, he was like her husband. She wondered sometimes if this was why it stung the Colonel so—that not only had their son been arrested, not only had he been in prison, not only had he failed out of medical school and been rusticated for political activity, but in doing all of that, he had rejected the Colonel himself. The Colonel had always had big plans for their son, ones that he tried to sell Mohammed on with little success (that Mohammed could become a property developer, that he could open up a chain of clinics and pharmacies from here to Zimbabwe, that he could become the President of Gold Lion himself) and while Mohammed received these with irritation and eventually outright contempt, when the Colonel spoke of them his wife sensed an enthusiasm born of love, of belief. Mohammed, he liked to tell her, in the sleepy moments when they lay in bed, almost asleep, was destined to do something great—he was a boy who would never be merely content to live in the safe shadows of those bigger than himself.
<br><br>
The music was coming to a slow stop. A sigh went up from the dancing couples. The President was back up on the stage, clapping his hands together.
<br><br>
“Forgive me, forgive me,” he said. “I will resume the music shortly. But we do have one more special presentation before the evening comes to an end. A very special presentation.”
<br><br>
A red-haired girl wearing a very short white dress was shimmying through the crowd, holding out a large object before her and smiling mischievously at everyone she passed, all bright lipstick and gums. As the girl ascended to the stage, hobbling a
<br><br>
little awkwardly on an absurdly high pair of shoes, the Colonel’s wife could see that the object was a large square, wrapped in string and brown paper. “Look at that dress,” the Colonel’s wife heard someone whisper disapprovingly behind her.
<br><br>
“Wonderful,” the President said, and then, loudly, “Mr. Ibrahim? Would you do us the honor of joining us on the stage?” The Colonel stepped away from his wife, and, conscious of everyone waiting for him, slowly ran a hand over his hair, and then both hands down the front of his tailored blue suit. He stepped carefully and slowly to the stage, as if bathing in the murmurs of appreciation that flowed around him. He did it with the kind of self-composure that suggested he had known all evening that this moment was coming, as if he never doubted that at some point,

everyone would be officially asked to gaze upon him.
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife stood below the stage. A few people nodded at her encouragingly. She looked around for her grandson, but in the dim lights could not quite make him out. At a corner in the back, she saw Rodney’s face illuminated by the lamplight at their table, drunk and half asleep.
<br><br>
“As our honored guest makes his way to the stage,” the President was saying, “let me just reiterate once more what a splendid job he has done. 25 million—I repeat that—25 million rand worth of new sales! Which begs the question, what were the rest of you lazy bastards doing?”
<br><br>
A laugh from the crowd. A shouted objection from a high-pitched voice, and then some theatrical admonishing from various voices.
<br><br>
“My wife doesn’t like me to swear,” the President chuckled.<br><br> “Well at least let me say that what we are celebrating tonight is bloody marvelous.”<br><br>

 
“They’re going to make a toast,” Anna whispered, suddenly next to the Colonel’s wife somehow, and so close that she could detect the sour wine scent on the woman’s warm breath. “Ag, you haven’t even got a glass. Where have those waiters gone? So lazy, they bugger off the moment they think they can get away with it. Let me go see.”
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife looked around. All evening the waiters had been swift and omnipresent, filling glasses, lifting plates, folding napkins, opening doors. They had functioned like silent gears, moving the party forward, entirely unnoticed. And now they had disappeared, as if they had never existed, although some of the guests held empty glasses, waggling them quizzically, waiting for the inevitable fill-up or a fresh drink.
<br><br>
“Now, Mr. Ibrahim,” the President was saying, as the Colonel stepped onto the stage, his hands folded before him like a little boy, rocking excitedly on his heels. “We don’t have too many handsome men in our business, as no doubt the ladies here this evening will have noticed.” The audience laughed again.
<br><br>
“I’ll find someone for you,” Anna whispered and walked away with quick, efficient steps.
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife felt isolated, visible. Naturally, people were turning to her and smiling, anticipating that she was enjoying this moment, that she was filled with pride. But something was troubling her. Anna was right—where had the waiters gone? It seemed like a sign. Something as serious as a barometer suddenly dropping and the sky growing dark and still. A sign that, in this room, only she could read. From the back of the room, she could hear some sort of exclamation.
<br><br>
“Oh, hush,” a man near her said. “People can be so rude.”<br><br> “So when we find an agent that’s handsome and good at

his job,” the President was saying, “of course we want to immortalize him.” At this, the Colonel laughed uproariously, the President joining in also, and then pausing slightly, only vaguely aware of some disturbance below, the ripples of which were now moving through the crowd, reaching the Colonel’s wife. She had the sensation of standing on a shore, the water lapping at her toes, nudging her slightly backwards, disrupting her center of gravity.
<br><br>
“And I must say,” the President continued, a tone of uncertainty still in his voice, “when I saw what the girls in the office had arranged for this gift, I thought, why not me? But then, I’m just the President of this company, not its best salesman!”
<br><br>
The Colonel’s wife turned on her heels and moved through the guests, heading for the back of the room where Anna had gone, to the swinging doors that led to the kitchen, ignoring the confused whispers around her. Behind her, the crowd was laughing again, and the President was continuing, emboldened by the response.
<br><br>
“As a sign of our appreciation, we present this portrait of you, Mr. Ibrahim, to be hung in our main Gold Lion office, to always speak of your fantastic achievement!” At this, the red-haired girl ripped away the brown paper to reveal a picture of the Colonel. In it, only his face was visible, large and looming, though it had no color. It had been sketched with pencils on a mauve background. The toast rose up from the guests, and camera flashes popped around them. A great applause broke out. The Colonel stared at the portrait, blinking.
<br><br>
If she had been there to see it, she might have mused on how little it looked like the Colonel, how clearly it had been created by a person who had never seen the Colonel in the flesh. But the Colonel’s wife was by then at the door of the kitchen,

peeping through it like a child, watching on a television screen around which the waiters had paused to gather at the sight of a riot breaking out in the street, the image of John Vorster Square surrounded by flames, of bodies at strange angles—laying where they had fallen, she thought, though she could not be sure—on the pavement in front of the building.
<br><br>
Beneath the stage, the crowd was still clapping enthusiastically. In the midst of all this, the little boy had danced away from Elizabeth’s hands. He had only known one type of applause in his life, and that was when his father had held him aloft at rallies, his eyes burning from stadium lights, the roar of approaching tanks distant, ever-nearing. It was much like now, as he stood alone before his grandfather: the crowd going wild, the sound of cameras, a panic latent beneath the joyous swell of noise. In the space between the Colonel and the guests, Riyaz appeared a solitary figure on two strong little legs, and lifted a fist up in salute. “Amandla!” he shouted, and then paused, giddily proud, looking around at the multitude of faces that stared at him, as though he quite enjoyed the stunned and confused silence that he had, all on his own, been the cause of.
