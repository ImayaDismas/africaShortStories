           <h1>The Folded Leaf<br>by Segun Afolabi</h1>
            <p>Segun Afolabi is the son of a career diplomat and spent his childhood moving from country to country, in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. This experience has been remarked upon by many critics as an obvious influence on his writing.</p>

                    <h5>by Segun Afolabi</h5>

                    <p>‘Bunmi! Bola!’ the cry rings out, Toyin calling from the other side of the road. At first they don’t hear it, but I do. We’re sitting in a circle around Reverend Abbe: Mrs Kekere, Tunde and Mr and Mrs Folorunsho’s eight-year old, Sam. Mama’s here too, as are Bola and Mrs Folorunsho, the six of us contained within a tight knot around the reverend, her thin white hair wrapped around her scalp like a halo, everyone says so.<br><br>
Reverend Abbe is eighty years old. She came late to the church and she’s only a deaconess, but we rarely refer to her as such. By we, I mean Papa, Mama, Bola and I and most of the parishioners along Leke Street. We have an actual reverend, in fact – Reverend Okulaja – but he doesn’t seem to resent Reverend Abbe.<br><br>
‘Bless Samuel, Father Jehovah,’ she says. ‘Today, today — please send him new legs.’<br><br>
I am trying not to giggle. Bola is shuddering beside me. At fourteen he should know better than to be disrespectful towards the reverend. I’m two years younger, so I use age as an excuse.<br><br>
‘Allow your messenger to heal your son Tunde this very today. Touch each of your children, Lord<br><br>
— Bunmi, Samuel, Tunde. And Mrs Kekere. Make them to be reborn in your presence. Make your spirit to descend down on top of them, to make them well and whole.’<br><br>
‘Yes, oh!’ Mama says, standing, raising her arms.<br><br>
The messenger the reverend referred to is Pastor Adejola Fayemi, or Daddy Cool as he is better known on account of his helicopter and Gulfstream jet and his homes in Florida and Switzerland and somewhere in the Caribbean. He has a penchant for wearing dark glasses and Tunde swears he’s never seen the pastor’s eyes before — not on TV, not in magazines or in the newspapers.<br><br>
‘They are calling you!’ Toyin shouts, this time from the entrance to the church, which is just a room off the street in a series of rooms in a low-lying building: Musa’s suya bar, a soft drinks shop, Daniel’s sewing parlour, Mama Yinka’s Emporium of Weave. Toyin falls silent when she realises we’re in the middle of prayer.<br><br>
‘Holy Father, allow no harm to meet your children on the road, no wickedness to touch them in<br><br>
Lagos,’ Reverend Abbe says. ‘Return them safely – today, today – with your holy blessings.’ She stops speaking, then after a full minute of silence she exhales and claps her hands and says, ‘My, my<br><br>
— what a wonderful day!’<br><br>
The sun streams through the window, warming the back of my neck. The morning cool has lifted. Sweat stains are certain to bloom across my Sunday dress and disgrace me in front of Papa.<br><br>
‘I beg, Ma,’ Toyin says. ‘The driver is here. They are waiting for you.’ By you she means Tunde, Sam, Bola, Mrs Kekere and me. By they she means Mr and Mrs Ejiofoh. And Papa.<br><br>
‘Wonderful!’ The reverend claps again. ‘Oya children — time to go. Mrs Kekere, let uscommot from here.’<br><br>
Three or four wooden planks connect the church to the road. Beneath the planks, a ditch filled with whatever anyone has chosen to discard. Tunde pushes Sam’s wheelchair behind me. Mama’s to my right, whispering ‘Sweet Jesus!’ on account of the stench. Bola’s gone ahead, sulking because he’ll miss football practise as he has to accompany me on this trip. Mrs Kekere trails behind us, clickety- clack with her canes.<br><br>
Tunde is sixteen. He has a hole in his heart. One day he might get out of bed and not have enough energy to take another step and flop down and die. It’s very dramatic, the way he describes it, as if he were talking about someone else. As if he hasn’t played football every other day alongside Bola or beaten Femi Adeleke to a pulp (Femi is a year older than Tunde) or played the Akpala sisters like a pair of slide guitars, strumming them both, Bonnie and Elizabeth, insensible, sending them scurrying to Ma Benga who performs her own brand of abortion. People think I don’t know.<br><br>
‘What is taking so long?’ Mr Ejiofoh shouts from the minibus. ‘What and what are these people doing?’<br><br>
‘Cannot you see we have been waiting?’ his wife chimes in.<br><br>
‘“Cannot you see we are waiting?”’ Tunde mimics behind me.<br><br>
Sam giggles.<br><br>
‘In the Lord’s good time,’ Reverend Abbe says, which silences everyone, although I hear Mrs Ejiofoh release a little pfff of displeasure.<br><br>
‘Bola — move from there!’ Papa calls. ‘That place is for Mrs Kekere, come and sit back here!’<br><br>
Mama hugs me for several long seconds before I climb aboard the bus. ‘Pray hard, my darling,’ she whispers. ‘The Lord will surely answer you.’<br><br>
‘Yes, Mama.’<br><br>
‘Wait, oh!’ Reverend Abbe says. ‘Bunmi, come here.’<br><br>
I shuffle back to the sliding door and the reverend brushes her fingers against my cheeks, my lips, my eyelids. Onion and garlic, a hint of sage. Has she no one to cook for her? Her fingers are trembling. ‘Blessings be with you, Bunmi, my dear. Blessings to all of you.’ And she steps back. It’s a mystery why she and Mama can’t join us, why the Ejiofohs are here instead. Papa says Bola is here to support me and help with the wheelchairs, but surely Mama could do that?<br><br>
‘Come and sit down, Bunmi,’ Papa says from the back row. He guides me to the space between him and Bola. I brush past Sam, who’s next to the sliding door, but what I notice is Mrs Ejiofoh beside him; her perfume overpowers even the reek of the ditch. I lower myself in increments before I can settle in the seat, which has been gently baking in the sun.<br><br>
‘Humph,’ Mrs Ejiofoh says. ‘Where is this woman? What and what are we waiting for, heh?’ A waft of floral notes tumbles over me as she flourishes her paper fan with abandon.<br><br>
This woman – Mrs Kekere – is beside Bola, making her way outside the bus. Her canes drag along the road and then the passenger door squeaks opens. ‘Help me with these things, joh,’ she says to<br><br>
Tunde, who will also occupy the passenger seat. She grunts as he helps her up and the minibus sinks a little to the right.<br><br>
‘Okay!’ the driver calls.<br><br>
‘Make we dey go now!’ Papa says.<br><br>
Mrs Ejiofoh slaps her hands twice, heavily, against each other, and says, ‘Hey-e-yeh!’ as if she’s never experienced anything as absurd as a bus load of invalids.<br><br>
We weave through town, along the unpaved roads. First there’s a whiff of thrown-up dust, then dry-fish pepper soup and the aroma of moyin-moyin, so we must be near Mama Boyega’s buka. Every so often a pedestrian taps against a window.<br><br>
‘Blessings!’ Mr Olawale shouts.<br><br>
‘Pray for me, oh!’ Auntie Ugome calls. Everyone knows where we’re going.<br><br>
‘Sammy, you will be dancing tonight, oh!’<br><br>
I don’t recognise the last voice, but Sam replies, ‘Eshay, Ma.’ I’m none the wiser, but I’m concerned about offering such encouragement to an eight-year-old boy.<br><br>
In no time we’re on the highway and the wind billows in and Mrs Ejiofoh screeches, ‘Close up that window!’ Her head tie has partly unravelled and whips against my cheek. She’s wearing embroidered lace so soft it must have cost a fortune. Last year Mr Ejiofoh took his family to Rome and they stayed at the Intercontinental. Bimbo, his daughter, drives a Volkswagen Passat. That’s why they’re on the bus, Mr and Mrs Ejiofoh, because you can never have too much. You give and then receive in abundance. They’re famous for their church donations.<br><br>
Sam obliges with the window.<br><br>
‘Bunmi, you want to sit here?’ Papa asks. ‘You are not hot?’<br><br>
‘I’m fine, Papa. A-Okay.’ Our code to indicate all is well. It’s pleasant with the wind sailing through the bus, my body no longer drenched and Mrs Ejiofoh’s perfume mitigated by the breeze.<br><br>
‘We have left town now,’ Papa explains. ‘We are on the road! We will be revived!’<br><br>
‘Amen!’ Mr Ejiofoh says in front of him.<br><br>
‘Amen!’ Mrs Kekere calls from the passenger seat, although she probably can’t hear Papa above the din of the engine. I can hear her talking to Tunde, though, and to the driver. The odd word: city, celestial, Okene, ewedu soup.<br><br>
‘What do you see?’ I ask Bola, who is noticeably silent and likely fuming since he was forced to give up his place beside Tunde.<br><br>
Bola doesn’t speak for a moment. He likes to take his time. ‘We just passed a woman carrying a metal bucket on her head and a girl washing her legs under a tap. There was a building, a blue building with a large Pepsi logo painted on one side, but now we’ve left that village and there’s nothing.’<br><br>
‘Nothing?’<br><br>
‘Well, just trees all around, but not close to the road. There are two or three metres of path on either side of the tarmac, then long grass, then the trees. Oh, and a lorry ahead of us — I think our driver is going to try to overtake it. It’s covered in green tarpaulin, strapped down with ropes. And there’s a sign at the back. It says DO NOT ... One minute — it’s a bit far away.’ He waits. ‘BE AFRAID. All the letters are written in white. In capital letters. What else do you want to know?’<br><br>
‘Hmm, I wonder what’s underneath the tarpaulin. Do you think it’s cows?’<br><br>
‘Bunmi, how would I know?’<br><br>
‘But you’ll tell me if you see something, won’t you?’<br><br>
‘Of course I will, you know that.’<br><br>
He doesn’t speak after this and I fear he may descend into one of his moods.<br><br>
‘Daddy,’ I begin to sing, ‘Daddy Cool,’ and in the end Bola joins me. I can tell from his tone that he’s smiling. ‘Daddy, Daddy Cool.’ Our private joke concerning Pastor Fayemi. ‘I’m crazy like a fool.’<br><br>
Papa leans towards us. ‘There are one thousand things to see and do in the city. Just you wait.<br><br>
This is just bush, there’s nothing to see here.’<br><br>
‘Things like what, Papa?’ I ask.<br><br>
‘Never have you seen so many cars before, Bunmi. Mercedes, BMW, Rolls Royce, you name it.<br><br>
More cars than people. And bridges — one bridge can stretch for miles. When we get there I will let you know.’<br><br>
Mrs Ejiofoh lets out a low chuckle.<br><br>
‘You think we will see a Rolls Royce, Papa?’ Bola asks.<br><br>
‘Why not? More than one. And offices that rise up to the sky. And swimming pools.’<br><br>
‘Really, Papa?’ I am sure he’s making it up.<br><br>
‘Bunmi, I am telling you. And the arena — just wait. Bola, open your eyes today, we will see wonders.’<br><br>
‘The wonders of Lagos,’ Mr Ejiofoh says, without enthusiasm.<br><br>
‘Just make sure you keep close,’ his wife says. ‘Don’t wander.’<br><br>
But I can sense the excitement in Papa’s voice, and in Bola’s too, and for the first time today I feel light enough to levitate above my seat, above the bus, above the landscape around us.<br><br>
‘Me, I want ice cream, oh!’ Sam says.<br><br>
‘Me too!’ Tunde says from the front.<br><br>
‘Ice cream, Papa?’ Bola asks.<br><br>
‘Of course,’ Papa says. ‘When we see the vendor, I will buy you one. Each of you.’<br><br>
‘Don’t worry,’ Mr Ejiofoh says. ‘Today the ice cream will be on me.’<br><br>
‘We are here to serve the Lord!’ Mrs Kekere pipes up from the front. Her hearing is sharper than I give her credit for. ‘Let us forget about ice cream and swimming pool and place our mind on prayer, isn’t it?’<br><br>
‘It is, shah,’ Mrs Ejiofoh replies.<br><br>
This has the immediate effect of silencing everyone even though we know Mrs Kekere would be the first to demolish an ice cream and then appeal for another.<br><br>
For a stretch we listen to the churn of the engine and the roaring road and the thud of percussion instruments from the front of the bus. The driver must have switched on the radio. I pick out the pluck of a steel guitar coupled with a man’s reedy voice and then backing singers as they belt out a chorus. That’s when I notice the wind dying down, the engine become a mere grumble. ‘Papa, are we stopping?’<br><br>
‘Road block!’ the driver says as he pulls to the side of the road. The radio is switched off.<br><br>
‘Pfff!’ goes Mrs Ejiofoh.<br><br>
Mrs Kekere begins to hum.<br><br>
‘What do you have inside?’ a voice demands from outside the bus.<br><br>
‘Police,’ Bola whispers.<br><br>
‘Just people,’ the driver says. ‘We go Lagos.’<br><br>
‘How many of you?’<br><br>
‘Well — ’<br><br>
The driver probably didn’t think to tally up his passengers<br><br>
‘Excuse,’ Mr Ejiofoh says. ‘We are nine in total.’<br><br>
Someone else is pacing around the bus. Footsteps halt somewhere between Papa and Mr Ejiofoh.<br><br>
‘So, you are not carrying something?’ continues the policeman beside the driver. ‘If we make our check, we will not find something, na so?’<br><br>
Mrs Kekere appears to be humming the tune to ‘Great Is Thy Faithfulness’.<br><br>
Footsteps continue behind the bus. A shadow lingers on the back of my head. A set of footsteps stops beside Sam, followed by a sharp rap against the door. ‘Open, joh!’ a policeman says and Sam begins to fumble with the latch. When the door slides opens, the policeman must see Sam’s withered legs. He must see them. His wheelchair is doubtless folded in the space in front of him. Or perhaps the policeman is not focused on Sam at all, he’s drawn to Mrs Ejiofoh and her soft lace and perfume.<br><br>
Mrs Kekere is humming at a gallop now, though she appears to have lost the capacity to hold a tune.<br><br>
‘That bag?’ the policeman asks. ‘What is inside?’<br><br>
‘Ah, ah! What is this?’ Mrs Ejiofoh says. ‘What is your business?’<br><br>
The policeman pauses, then speaks almost inaudibly. ‘What did you say?’ He sounds as if he is about to climb aboard the bus and illustrate why Mrs Ejiofoh should never answer back to a policeman.<br><br>
Papa pats my leg. I cannot hear Bola breathe.<br><br>
‘Mr Man!’ Mrs Kekere says so that everyone can hear. ‘What do you want with us, heh? We are going to praise the Lord. In Lagos. We are not richy-rich people. Leave these sick children, joh, and let us not to be late. God is watching you.’<br><br>
What follows is a period of silence or contemplation, a quick shuffling of clothes, the unfurling of an agbada. ‘Please,’ Mr Ejiofoh says. ‘Please take this for your trouble, you and your colleagues.’ There’s a pleading quality to his voice I have never heard before, a slight tremor, an absence of dignity.<br><br>
‘Eshay, sah,’ comes the reply. ‘Thank you, sah.’ The sliding door is slammed shut. The bus shudders. ‘Oya, let these people go!’ The policeman bangs the side of the bus and we draw away from the sound of guffaws.<br><br>
Mrs Kekere resumes her humming; another tune this time — ‘Sweet Is the Light’.Minutes later the driver switches on the radio, or perhaps Tunde has had enough of Mrs Kekere’s warbling.<br><br>
‘Did they have guns?’ I ask.<br><br>
‘Let us think no more about it,’ Papa says and he begins, perhaps unconsciously, to hum along with Mrs Kekere.<br><br>
People ask me sometimes what I think Papa looks like and Mama and Bola, how I imagine myself. I have always been blind. How they appear to me, and my own understanding of myself, might not compare with other people’s perceptions. But do any of us identify the same thing in exactly the same way? The shape of an egg, the colour blue, the smell of a leaf? That’s what Bola says sometimes. So don’t worry, he says. And Bola’s right about most things.<br><br>
Mama is taller than me – for now – and I’m shorter than Papa and Bola. She has a heart-shaped face and sometimes she places my fingers on her dimples when she smiles. She smiles constantly, unlike Bola, who hardly ever cracks a grin.<br><br>
Papa broke his leg in a motorcycle accident before he met Mama, so he walks with a slight limp, but he’s the strongest person I know. Stronger than Tunde. He visits Elias the barber every two or three weeks because he has so much hair, which never seems to stop growing. I love the feel of it against my face when he reaches down to say goodnight.<br><br>
A car toots. Another responds in kind. We are no longer driving at speed.<br><br>
‘Where are we now?’ I ask.<br><br>
Silence.<br><br>
‘Bola?’<br><br>
‘Hmm?’<br><br>
‘Were you sleeping?’<br><br>
‘No. Maybe. What did you say?’<br><br>
‘Are we nearly there?’<br><br>
‘I don’t know. There are more houses. Not many trees. And cars. Lots of cars.’<br><br>
‘Can you see the offices in the sky?’<br><br>
‘No, not yet.’<br><br>
‘We have some time until we reach the city,’ Papa says. ‘This is just the suburbs. That’s how big it
is.’<br><br>
‘This is Lagos,’ Mrs Ejiofoh says. ‘Only there is so much traffic you cannot get from A to B without hypertension.’<br><br>
‘Are we going to be late?’<br><br>
‘Bunmi, stop worrying,’ Papa says. ‘There will be worshipping long into the night.’<br><br>
Thirty minutes later the boom of a car’s speakers buffets the minibus like a gust of wind.<br><br>
‘Hey-e-yeh!’ the driver says. ‘Lagos people dey craze!’<br><br>
‘What kind of car is making that noise?’ I ask Bola.<br><br>
‘It’s not a car. It’s coming from a shop.’<br><br>
We drive on and the volume subsides behind us. It’s confusing not to be able to recognise sounds, the sources of sounds. I’m having difficulty building a picture of this world in my mind.<br><br>
The honking and snarling around us swells into a new kind of language, like a million crows crying out at the same time. We move forward a few metres, then idle, again and again.
‘What do you see?’<br><br>
‘A traffic jam.’ ‘Please, Bola.’<br><br>
He exhales. ‘Okay, let’s see. There’s a market to your left. Just clothes and vegetables and one or two electrical shops and a place selling generators. Lots of cars in front of us and behind too — most of them yellow taxis.’ He hardly pauses this time. ‘There’s a pot hole in the middle of the road, so all the cars are steering around it and there’s a boy there. Maybe seven or eight years old. He’s moving from one car to another. I don’t think he has any legs.’<br><br>
‘Oh,’ I say. Now everything is upside down. I was trying to gauge the size of the pot hole, hoping the driver would do his best to swerve away from it, bracing myself for a potential bump. Now there’s a child in my head, with no legs. I am trying to understand what that looks like, how he is able to move between cars without thighs and knees, ankles and toes. I shift closer to Bola. ‘What does he look like, that boy?’<br><br>
‘Like a boy,’ Bola says. ‘What do you mean?’<br><br>
‘How can he ... Is he in a wheelchair?’<br><br>
‘No — he is using his hands. And his arms. He’s actually moving very fast.’<br><br>
‘The road, isn’t it dirty? Is he not low low down? What if the drivers can’t see him?’<br><br>
Bola doesn’t reply straight away. He says, ‘Well, I think they can see him. The cars can’t move very fast in this traffic.’<br><br>
‘But what does he look like?’<br><br>
‘Bunmi, I told you already.’<br><br>
‘I mean his face. His expression. Please, Bola.’ I can’t explain it exactly, even to Bola. ‘What does his face say to you?’<br><br>
‘Bunmi ... Well, he seems — his tongue is sticking out a little. He’s pushing hard with his hands and his singlet is dragging on the ground. He is trying to get money, from the drivers and from the people sitting in the back seats, but they’re not winding down their windows.’
‘His face, Bola.’<br><br>
‘Okay, he looks ... not tired, but maybe like he needs to rest. You know? Remember when you walk home after school, then run a little, then walk again to catch your breath?’<br><br>
‘Yes.’<br><br>
‘Like that. He looks like he needs to catch his breath for a minute. But he’s smiling too when he holds out his hand.’<br><br>
‘Yes, I think I see it.’ I’m building a picture of velocity and metal and chaos and heat. And in amongst that, a tiny, scuttling bundle of flesh. A smile. ‘It doesn’t sound as if he’s paying attention to where he is. Isn’t it dangerous in between those cars?’<br><br>
‘I think you’re right,’ Bola says. I feel him turn, look behind. ‘I can’t see him any more.’<br><br>
We are quiet now, listening only to the honking and shouting, a ripple of laughter to my right. There may be an intersection nearby, a crowd attempting to cross the street. Right now I don’t want to know.<br><br>
‘What do you think will happen to that boy when he is older, when he is as old as Papa or Mr Ejiofoh?’ And then I remember Sam, sitting in front of us and I am ashamed of my relentless curiosity.<br><br>
‘I don’t know,’ Bola says after a while.<br><br>
‘God does not like the poor!’ The pastor’s voice booms through loudspeakers all around us. We’ve been instructed to take notes and I can hear the frenzied rustle of paper. ‘We have all the riches of the world right here, right now! He gave us wealth, more than we can imagine. There is no excuse not to partake. Listen to this: “A fool wallows with the pigs in the pen.” You write that down!’<br><br>
We’re at the back of the arena listening to Pastor Fayemi, who has a voice like the man on the six o’clock news, only he sounds angry, as if we have done something to displease him. When we arrived Mrs Kekere was crestfallen not to be invited to the front row, but she has begun to sing, calling out
her amens whenever the spirit takes her. Tunde hasn’t yet spotted an aeroplane or a helicopter, and of the pastor, he says, ‘The stage is miles away.’<br><br>
Mr and Mrs Ejiofoh were whisked away to the VIP area. One glance at Sam and Mrs Kekere and me and the staff ushered the rest of us to the back of the arena. Talk of ice cream and bridges and buildings that puncture the clouds has long since faded.<br><br>
‘Jesus, this place is wheelchair city!’ Tunde says with such awe it might go some way to alleviating his disappointment about the lack of aircraft.<br><br>
‘Do not use the Lord’s name in vain,’ Mrs Kekere says.<br><br>
I wonder what he’s wearing, the pastor, what he looks like up close, whether there’s a holy aura around him like Reverend Abbe.<br><br>
‘How will we reach the stage?’ Bola asks.<br><br>
‘When they call us, we start running,’ Papa says. ‘You hold your sister. I will push Sam. Tunde — you hold Mrs Kekere, you hear?’<br><br>
‘Yes, sah.’<br><br>
‘Wonderful. We are ready.’ I can hear the wide grin in Papa’s voice.<br><br>
‘I feel hot,’ Sam says.<br><br>
It’s true — it’s stifling in here. My dress is already limp with the humidity. The flutter of a thousand paper fans fills the air like flamingos taking flight.<br><br>
The choir begins to sing and all around me people join in.
‘How do you know the words?’ I ask Bola. ‘I don’t know these new songs they’re singing.’<br><br>
‘They’re up on a screen.’<br><br>
‘Sing along if you can,’ Papa says. ‘But don’t worry, Bunmi. We are going up soon, Jehovah!’ He gives my arm a quick squeeze – his hand hot and clammy – and continues to sing, his voice ringing clear above others around us.<br><br>
Something is happening to Papa, to the congregation. Thousands upon thousands of voices bellowing in unison, the choir electrifying the stage, the presence of the pastor like a fire in our midst. And this heat, like fear or happiness, coursing through my body.<br><br>
‘How now, Bunmi?’<br><br>
‘A-Okay, Papa.’<br><br>
The choir launches into a medley of hymns, and then the pastor cries, ‘Hallelujah! Hallelujah!’ and everyone roars, ‘Hallelujah!’ in return.<br><br>
‘And is it not good to be in the presence of the Lord?’ the pastor shouts.<br><br>
The congregation responds with a resounding, ‘Yes, oh!’<br><br>
‘I am telling you,’ the pastor says. ‘There will be healing tonight. Stand up from that wheelchair!’<br><br>
And a hush descends upon the crowd.<br><br>
‘Not you Sam,’ Papa whispers. ‘He’s talking to someone on the stage.’<br><br>
‘To give is to please the Lord,’ the pastor continues. ‘So give generously my children!’<br><br>
‘Did you see someone get up from their wheelchair?’ I ask.<br><br>
‘They didn’t show it on the screen,’ Bola says. ‘And I can’t see anything from here.’<br><br>
‘Not long now,’ Papa says. ‘Mrs Kekere — prepare yourself.’<br><br>
‘I am already prepared,’ she says, ‘even before today.’<br><br>
Silence. Noise. Silence again. The sounds slipping away, returning — a seashell back and forth against my ear. I am both giddy and fearful. I have always been afraid, I know, of the night, of silence, of losing Mama or Papa, of Bola running away, never hearing from him again. More than anything, I am afraid the pastor will see right through me to my sin, my doubt, my disbelief. I am frightened because, in spite of myself, I want so much for something to happen.<br><br>
‘Tunde, Mrs Kekere — take this,’ Papa says. ‘Sam, Bola — one one for each of you.’ He must be distributing the funds we’ve raised in church, months of donations sealed in envelopes, used partly to pay for the driver and the minibus and today’s collection.<br><br>
‘Stop trying to stand,’ Tunde says. ‘He wasn’t talking to you.’<br><br>
‘But I can feel something,’ Sam says.<br><br>
‘Give all you can!’ a voice booms, though not Pastor Fayemi’s. ‘He sees into your hearts. Don’t cheat Him, oh!’<br><br>
‘Who is that?’ I ask.<br><br>
‘There are many pastors up there,’ Bola says. ‘They’re taking turns to speak. They’re wearing suits, mostly black suits. Daddy Cool is wearing white.’<br><br>
Sweat trickles down the sides of my face and each intake of breath in this humidity is increasingly hard-earned. Halfway through a hymn the music fades and a voice from the stage shouts, ‘Did you see that? Cancer has just left that girl! Did you see it fly away? Hallelujah!’<br><br>
Gasps escape throughout the arena and people begin to call out names — of loved ones, their own names, Jehovah, Jesu, Lord. I want to see the girl who was healed. I want to see the cancer leave her body, the fetid lump of it flung into the air, her face now she has been healed. I want to see. Now. I am ready.<br><br>
‘Time to go up,’ Papa says. ‘Bola, hold Bunmi tight. Don’t let her get lost, you hear?’<br><br>
‘Yes, Papa.’<br><br>
‘Tunde, Mrs Kekere — you go first. Sam and I will follow.’
And we’re off, Bola with an arm around me, half-running to keep up with Tunde and Mrs Kekere. Is Tunde carrying her? Perhaps someone from the congregation is helping. I miss my step and stumble.<br><br>
I cannot find my balance at this speed. Bola props me up, holds me tighter. ‘Sorry, Bunmi.’<br><br>
Bola is so lean against me, perhaps I should be offering the support. I hadn’t realised how thin he has become. It makes me wonder if he is eating properly, whether the hours of football are taking their toll.<br><br>
‘Follow those people!’ a woman says behind me and I’m aware we are part of a mass headed for the same place. It gives me hope, this communion, this flock of kindred souls. I no longer care that I’m sweating, that I’m stumbling like a drunk. I am only in love with love, with the thought that love is on the stage and, when I reach it, when I touch it, I will be made whole.<br><br>
‘An old woman is dancing on stage!’ Bola cries. ‘She just threw her cane down! Bunmi, she’s really dancing!’<br><br>
‘Bola, hurry.’ I have never heard him so engaged. ‘Let Sam and Mrs Kekere dance too. And
Tunde, let his heart be healed. And that boy with no legs, we will pray for him.’<br><br>
‘We will all see healing tonight,’ Bola says, half-dragging, half-carrying me now.<br><br>
‘Are we there, Papa?’<br><br>
‘Not far, Bunmi. You will see each of us tonight, He has ordained it. He is watching over us today today. You will see the green leaves and the white clouds and your Mama’s face.’ His voice begins to break, from the strain of the day, from pushing Sam, from pushing all of us to flourish.<br><br>
‘Mr Man!’ That can only be Mrs Kekere. ‘Mr Man, move away! Cannot you see you are standing in the road?’<br><br>
‘Wait, Bunmi,’ Bola says. ‘Slow down.’<br><br>
‘Let us pass!’ This is Papa.<br><br>
‘Commot for road!’ Tunde says.<br><br>
‘Who and who is going where with this wheelchair?’ It’s a man’s voice. Calm, but firm.<br><br>
‘What are you talking?’ Mrs Kekere says. ‘I beg, let us pass, joh.’<br><br>
‘Have you received healing?’ another man says.<br><br>
‘Who are those people?’ I ask.<br><br>
‘They’re wearing suits,’ Bola says.<br><br>
Have we received healing? Are we not all waiting to be healed? Have we not driven all this way to be renewed, touched, reborn?<br><br>
‘Brother, what do you mean?’ Papa has a smile in his voice, as if he understands that the men have made an error which they will no doubt soon correct. ‘We are going up there, for the healing, don’t you know?’<br><br>
‘Better sit down,’ one of the men says. ‘No obstruction or wheelchair. Pastor Fayemi can reach you wherever you are. Please, move back so these people can pass.’<br><br>
‘Move, joh,’ someone says behind me.<br><br>
‘No, no — you don’t understand,’ Papa says. ‘We have been travelling all day, you see. Here is my daughter, Bunmi. She must meet Pastor Fayemi. My son Bola, Mrs Kekere, Sam — ’
‘What is this?’ A new voice. Movement, a brisk kerfuffle, someone drawing close to Papa.<br><br>
‘Reinforcements,’ Bola says.<br><br>
‘Move from the road, my friend,’ the new voice says. ‘Who asked you to move from your seat?’<br><br>
‘But — ’ Papa says.<br><br>
‘You sit down now. All of you.’ The man speaks so quietly, his words can only be meant for Papa, but I hear them too. It does not sound like a request. His voice has the timbre of someone who could knock Tunde to the other side of the arena.<br><br>
‘Oh, okay.’ Papa gives a half-hearted chuckle, but I hear anxiety and capitulation in his voice, as if an invisible hand has reached down and folded him in half, and half again, like a leaf or a scrap of paper.<br><br>
‘Bola, you go,’ Papa says. ‘You run and don’t look back.’<br><br>
‘But Bunmi — ’<br><br>
‘Just go, I said. You pray for your sister. You pray for all of us. Go now.’<br><br>
Bola leaves without a word and I am left with the hubbub of the crowd, dread in my stomach, people jostling me from all sides and the floor tilting now against my volition. Mrs Ejiofoh’s words come rushing back to me. ‘Keep close, Papa.’<br><br>
He catches me just as I am about to slide to the floor. His arms are damp, almost wet, and I can smell his perspiration. Papa never complains. He perseveres. ‘I am sorry, Bunmi. Sorry. Hold onto my arm.’<br><br>
He guides me with one hand and manoeuvres Sam’s wheelchair with the other and we return to our seats. It does not seem so difficult for him to manage and it occurs to me that Bola needn’t have come. Could his space in the bus not have been given to Lola or Osawe or Jibola, who has been diabetic for most of his life? As we trundle back it dawns on me why Mama and Papa insisted Bola join us today. He isn’t here to help me or Sam or Mrs Kekere; he too has come to be healed. How could I have failed to understood?<br><br>
‘Atcha!’ Mrs Kekere slumps to her seat. ‘What kind of people are these people? That we can come all this distance, for what? For water? Heh? Tunde, don’t mind me, sef. Go up there and join Bola. I can stay here by myself.’<br><br>
‘Don’t worry, Ma,’ Tunde says. ‘It’s okay.’<br><br>
‘What and what is okay? Go up and receive healing.’<br><br>
‘Don’t worry, Ma,’ he repeats. ‘Sam, stop trying to stand up. You are going to exhaust yourself.’<br><br>
‘But I’m not tired,’ Sam says. ‘See?’<br><br>
I hear his wheelchair creaking from side to side, his little groans of exertion. But more than anything, I hear Papa’s silence. ‘Sam, stop,’ I say. I try to be as gentle as I can.<br><br>
‘Keep praying Sammy, dear,’ Mrs Kekere says. ‘We will each of us see healing in our lifetime, don’t you worry.’<br><br>
Papa has not spoken in so long, I don’t know what to do or say. I don’t need anyone to describe the expression on his face.<br><br>
‘Another arthritis has been healed!’ a man shouts from the stage. ‘Hallelujah!’<br><br>
‘Hallelujah!’ the congregation choruses.<br><br>
‘Praise Jesus!’ Mrs Kekere calls and I am amazed at the strength of her conviction.<br><br>
‘Not yet,’ Papa says at last, rubbing his hands together, letting out a little clap at the end.<br><br>
‘What’s not yet, Papa?’<br><br>
‘The pastor has not yet blessed your brother. I am watching on the screen. So many people are waiting in line. When he goes up, I will let you know.’<br><br>
Papa must return home to face Mama and Reverend Abbe and Reverend Okulaja and all the members of our congregation. He will have to explain how we came so close and how we were turned away, how we gave away all the donations in a single collection.<br><br>
‘You are disappointed, Papa.’<br><br>
He remains silent and I wonder if he has not heard me. Cries go up throughout the hall and I assume another person has been healed.<br><br>
‘No, Bunmi. I am not disappointed. Remember what the steward said? We can receive blessings from here. He sees all of us, all of the time. Don’t forget that. Don’t allow your faith to grow dim.’<br><br>
‘Yes, Papa,’ I say. But how can it be dimmed if it is barely lit to begin with?<br><br>
‘Bola is on TV!’ Sam says.<br><br>
‘Really?’ I imagine a lanky boy with hair about an inch long, like Papa’s, cut and combed by Elias especially for today. Thin cotton trousers. A smart, button-down shirt. I forgot to ask him about the colour.<br><br>
‘Really, Bunmi. I am not joking you,’ Sam says. ‘He is up there with Daddy Cool.’<br><br>
‘Yes he is,’ Papa says, his voice filled with pride.<br><br>
I cannot guess the colour of Bola’s shirt. I can’t envisage him on the stage. And how I wish I were back home, back in the familiar. Mama would know what to say to Sam, how to console Papa, how to calm this wildness in my chest. Is Bola overwhelmed by the adoration of the crowd? Is he frightened as he’s thrust in front of the pastor?<br><br>
‘He is coming down from that stage,’ Sam says.<br><br>
‘That was quick. Papa?’<br><br>
Papa doesn’t speak.<br><br>
‘Sam, what does he look like? Can you describe him for me?’<br><br>
‘Who, Bola?’<br><br>
‘No, Daddy Cool.’<br><br>
‘Pastor Fayemi,’ Papa says.<br><br>
‘He is wearing suit. A white suit and white shoes. Very fine. And cap. A white cap.’<br><br>
‘What kind of cap?’<br><br>
‘I don’t know.’<br><br>
‘A cowboy cap,’ Papa says. ‘Like in the movies.’<br><br>
‘Can you describe his face, Sam?’<br><br>
‘Ah, ah — I don’t know.’ He sounds unnerved by my request. I forget sometimes how much I rely on Bola.<br><br>
‘He is wearing sunglasses,’ Sam says. ‘I don’t see his face well. Maybe he has craw-craw skin.’<br><br>
‘Stop talking nonsense Sam,’ Mrs Kekere says.<br><br>
‘Sorry, Ma.’<br><br>
‘Sunglasses,’ I say. ‘I forgot about that.’<br><br>
We’re in the bus, driving home in the evening. I am thinking about the pastor. His sunglasses, his aeroplane and stage show, his homes across the world. I’m thinking of Papa beside me, folded and put away like a letter. What a fool I have been to be drawn into all this when I have known, from the beginning, that I will never fully comprehend what Papa looks like or see Mama or witness the twinge of pain on Bola’s face when Elizabeth Akpala and Tunde walk by hand in hand and he only sees<br><br>
Tunde, but Tunde does not see him. I understand this. Bola can play football alongside him till kingdom come, but this will change nothing. Sam will not dance tonight, Tunde will still have a hole in his heart and Mrs Kekere will have to live with her arthritis after all.<br><br>
‘Are you sure you can still see it?’ Mrs Ejiofoh is playing I Spy with Sam, but she is not doing so well.
‘I can, Ma.’<br><br>
‘What can begin with S in this darkness?’<br><br>
Sam giggles. ‘You must guess, don’t you know?’<br><br>
Papa is breathing heavily beside me. He must be exhausted. From the radio comes the
lull of a Hawaiian guitar and a woman’s voice, uneven as sandpaper.<br><br>
‘What can you see?’ I ask Bola. ‘Can you describe it for me?’<br><br>
Silence.<br><br>
I know he isn’t asleep.<br><br>
‘Trees,’ he says eventually. ‘At the sides of the road and in front of us. I can see them in the headlights. And up there are many stars.’<br><br>
‘Stars!’ cries Mrs Ejiofoh.<br><br>
‘That’s not fair!’ Sam says. ‘Bola helped you.’<br><br>
‘My turn now,’ Mrs Ejiofoh says, regardless. ‘I can spy something starting with a T.’<br><br>
‘Mrs Kekere is sleeping,’ Bola continues. ‘Her head is against the window. Mr Ejiofoh and Papa are sleeping too. I can’t see anything else.’<br><br>
‘What about Tunde?’<br><br>
‘Tunde!’ Sam says.<br><br>
‘Oh, you’re good at this,’ says Mrs Ejiofoh.<br><br>
‘What about him?’ Bola asks.<br><br>
‘Is he sleeping too?’<br><br>
‘Bunmi, we’re not even halfway home. Aren’t you tired?’<br><br>
I sigh and lean my head against his shoulder. There isn’t much to it, just bone and sparse muscle behind a thin cotton shirt.<br><br>
‘What colour is your shirt?’ I whisper. ‘I forgot to ask.’<br><br>
‘It’s blue, Bunmi. Bright blue. Azure. Like the sky and sometimes the sea, remember?’<br><br>
‘I do, I remember. Bola, are you healed?’ The roar of the road against the tires is like the crash of ocean waves. I imagine the forest ambushing the minibus from all sides, being held back by the glare of its headlights, folding in again, pursuing us from behind. I feel Bola exhale and lean against the window and when at last I think he will speak, he says nothing.<br><br>
I wanted life, my life, to mean something beyond this sightlessness. I wanted it to be a gift, a sign from God, from somewhere, that there was purpose behind it, a larger plan. But I’m beginning to understand that I will not be led to grace. There will be days when I rail against my inability to appreciate the pattern of a leaf or the colour of a cotton shirt or witness a boy with no legs eking out a kind of existence. I am beginning to understand that this is my life, that it is good enough. I have Mama and Papa and Bola to thank, Reverend Abbe, our congregation, all the people on our street.<br><br>
As I am considering this, Papa yawns, shifts in his seat. ‘Bunmi, there is nothing — ’ he says and stops. ‘Bola does not need to be healed, you hear? He is with the Lord and he is in our hearts. Why don’t you get some rest and stop chattering? Other people are trying to sleep.’<br><br>
‘Yes, Papa.’ And I feel Bola tense up against me, his heartbeat thump wildly. After a long minute he begins to relax. I was convinced Papa was sleeping.<br><br>
‘I know,’ Mrs Ejiofoh says. ‘I see something starting with A — A for apple. You are never going to guess, young man.’<br><br>
‘I spy,’ Sam says. ‘Not, I see. You are not playing well.’<br><br>
When I am grown, will I remember Reverend Abbe’s onion-scented fingers, her kindness, Do Not
Be Afraid splashed across the back of a lorry, the sweat and fervour of the arena, Bola’s desire to be reborn? A boy dragging himself along the road in the middle of traffic? How could I forget him? I pray he has shelter at this hour and people he can rely on. Good people. His smile. I pray he never loses sight of that.</p>
